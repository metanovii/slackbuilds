# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

srtp: This package provides an implementation of the Secure Real-time
srtp: Transport Protocol (SRTP), the Universal Security Transform (UST), and
srtp: a supporting cryptographic kernel.  These mechanisms are documented in
srtp: the Internet Drafts in the doc/ subdirectory.  The SRTP API is
srtp: documented in include/srtp.h, and the library is in libsrtp.a (after
srtp: compilation).  An overview and reference manual is available in
srtp: doc/libsrtp.pdf.  The PDF documentation is more up to date than this
srtp: file.
